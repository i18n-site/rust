* [i18 : MarkDown Command Line Translation Tool](https://i18n.site/i18)

  The translation perfectly maintains the Markdown format.

  It recognizes file changes and only translates the modified files.

  The translated Markdown content is editable; if you modify the original text and translate it again, manually edited translations will not be overwritten (as long as the original text has not been changed).

* [i18n.site : MarkDown Multi-language Static Site Generator](https://i18n.site/i18n.site)

  Optimized for a better reading experience
